Facial Image semantic transformation aims to convert one image into another image with
different semantic features (e.g., face pose, hairstyle). The previous methods, which learn
the mapping function from one image domain to the other, require supervised information
directly or indirectly. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised facial image seman-
tic transformation method called semantic transformation generative adversarial networks
(ST-GAN). We further improve ST-GAN with the Wasserstein distance to generate more
realistic images and propose a method called local mutual information maximization to
obtain a more explicit semantic transformation. ST-GAN has the ability to map the image
semantic features into the latent vector and then perform transformation by controlling
the latent vector. After the proposed framework is trained on a benchmark, the original
face images can be reconstructed and then translated into various images with different
semantic features.
